## Overview

This project showcases a full-cycle machine learning pipeline using the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) — one of the most renowned datasets in classification. The process includes:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing  
- Training a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, or your chosen algorithm)  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Exporting the trained model  
- Loading the model for inference  
- Serving predictions through an API via `app.py`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (as specified in `.python-version`)  
- Virtual environment tool like `venv` or Poetry  
- Recommended: Poetry for dependency and environment management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunalshinde1214/iris_ml_project.git
   cd iris_ml_project

2. Set up the environment:

Using venv:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

Using Poetry:

poetry install
poetry shell



3. Ensure the data/ directory contains the Iris dataset (iris.csv). If not included, download it using:

wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data \
  -O data/iris.csv

Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation

train.py reads the dataset from data/, cleans/preprocesses it (e.g., handling missing values, scaling, encoding), splits it into train/test sets, and initiates model training.


2. Model Training

train.py trains your chosen classifier (such as logistic regression, SVM, etc.).

After evaluation, the trained model is serialized and saved under models/ (e.g., models/iris_model.joblib).


3. Model Inference

inference.py loads the serialized model and takes sample data (either from file or input), returning predictions with optional probability estimates.


4. API Deployment

app.py serves as an API endpoint — possibly with FastAPI or Flask — to handle HTTP requests for predictions.

Run the API locally with, for example:

uvicorn app:app --reload

The endpoint (e.g., /predict) accepts JSON input with feature values and returns predicted class labels (and probabilities if applicable).

Configuration & Constants

constants.py holds reusable configuration values, such as:

File paths (e.g., DATA_PATH, MODEL_PATH)

Random seeds

Model hyperparameters

Feature names



Use this module to avoid hardcoding values across scripts.

Development & Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Consider the following steps:

1. Fork the repository


2. Create a new feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature


3. Make enhancements (e.g., support for more classifiers, improved API, dockerization)


4. Update documentation (README.md) accordingly


5. Commit your changes and push to your fork


6. Open a Pull Request



Please ensure that:

New dependencies are reflected in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml

The code is well-documented (docstrings or comments)

Reproducibility is maintained with all filesystem paths relative and no hardcoded secrets
